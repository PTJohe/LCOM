All the labs and final project developed for the course unit "Computer Labs".

## Final project

The final project is based on the popular children's books "Where's Wally".

There are two different game modes: Arcade Mode and Stage Select.

In **Arcade mode**, you'll go through each stage trying to find Wally, easily recognized by his distinctive red-and-white-striped shirt, bobble hat, and glasses. You must do it before the timer runs out.

On the other hand, **Stage Select** lets you choose any of the stages, with the added difficulty of finding not only Wally but also his friends: Whitebeard, Wenda and Odlaw.
